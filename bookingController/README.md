# **Booking Controller**
## **Role of the component**
The aim of this component is to receive and process the userâ€™s booking request that will be sent from the _User Request Validator_ component. The _Booking Controller_ component will create an appointment according to the information that is the user booking request. It will save the appointment in the database, send a confirmation message to the user who does the booking. 

## **How it connects with the other components and its role in the software architecture**
The _Booking Controller_ component plays a role in the **Publish/(Un)Subscribe** architectural style which we are using in our distributed systems. This component will act as both a **Publisher** and a **Subscriber**. In order for this component to fulfill its role of creating and saving an appointment, the _Booking Controller_ will act as a **Subscriber** to receive the user request which will hold the information of the booking. This user request will be originally published by the _User Booking GUI_, but the _User Request Validator_ is the component that will receive it first to validate it, and then publish it to the _Booking Controller_ if the validation is successful. Once the _Booking Controller_ is done creating and saving an appointment using the information in the user request message, it will act as a **Publisher** and send a confirmation message of the booking to the _User Booking GUI_ component.
